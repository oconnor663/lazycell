//! This crate provides a LazyCell struct which acts as a lazily filled Cell,
//! but with frozen contents.
//!
//! With a `RefCell`, the inner contents cannot be borrowed for the lifetime of
//! the entire object, but only of the borrows returned. A `LazyCell` is a
//! variation on `RefCell` which allows borrows tied to the lifetime of the
//! outer object.
//!
//! The limitation of a `LazyCell` is that after initialized, it can never be
//! modified.
